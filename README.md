# InfecScan

This is InfecScan, an Al model that gathers user symptoms through targeted questioning, employing natural language processing for accuracy. The system cross-references symptoms with medical databases to detect potential diseases. It delivers personalised healthcare advice, including exercise suggestions and doctor referrals. The platform extends support through counseling services, incorporating a suicide helpline chatbot for mental health assistance.
This integrated solution offers convenient and proactive healthcare management, addressing post-pandemic challenges and fostering holistic well-being.

I've made all the frontend of the website, and the backend part was done by my teammate Apoorv Mittal
